# hello-world
to present new ideas 

This all is for having a place to have my projects for anyone to see.
As a student and a future professional I find it valuable 
when people are giving me feedback for my work. So shoot! Let's keep
it constructive, thx :) Unless the only option is to explode, ha ha.
